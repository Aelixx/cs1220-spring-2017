## Announcements

- **5/4/2017** Here is the link to John Resig's slides on [Introduction to jQuery](https://johnresig.com/apps/workshop/intro/)

- **3/21/2017** Reminder that test this Wednesday will consist of two parts:
  - Part 1: 5 - 10 facts/short answer questions; you will need to complete this part first turn the exam back to the instructor; then proceed to Part 2.  For this part you can have **one study note** sheet.
  - Part 2: 2 - 3 longer coding questions; you can do this on the computer and submit this to CSNS.  Make sure that you have a CSNS account.  This part is open book and open notes.  You can use the Internet to look for reference and information.

A good way to prepare for the exam is to do the practice problems at the end of each chapter.

- **3/6/2017** Please note that I have to travel conflict with lecture schedule this week.  You will need to watch the following videos:

   - OSTraining [The Absolute Beginners Guide to Bootstrap](https://youtu.be/WpzT-pTImyo).  This is a rehash of the materials that we've been covering in class -- but in a different way.

   - Traversy Media [Bootstrap Beginning Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GcQtLDGXy8).  This is probably the best introduction to bootstrap.

   - Derek Banas [Bootstrap Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gqOEoUR5RHg).  This is a comprehensive tutorial and can be overwhelming.  So watch it slowly and digest it in small chunks...

- **1/30/2017** Discussion board is up.  Please visit [https://gitter.im/cs1220-spring-2017/discussion](https://gitter.im/cs1220-spring-2017/discussion) for real-time web development excitement.
