## Announcements

- **1/30/2017** Discussion board is up.  Please visit [https://gitter.im/cs1220-spring-2017/discussion](https://gitter.im/cs1220-spring-2017/discussion) for real-time web development excitement.

- **3/6/2017** Please note that I have to travel conflict with lecture schedule this week.  You will need to watch the following videos:

   - OSTraining [The Absolute Beginners Guide to Bootstrap](https://youtu.be/WpzT-pTImyo).  This is a rehash of the materials that we've been covering in class -- but in a different way.

   - Traversy Media [Bootstrap Beginning Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GcQtLDGXy8).  This is probably the best introduction to bootstrap.

   - Derek Banas [Bootstrap Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gqOEoUR5RHg).  This is a comprehensive tutorial and can be overwhelming.  So watch it slowly and digest it in small chunks...
